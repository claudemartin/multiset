# Multiset in Java

You only need one single file:
https://github.com/claudemartin/multiset/blob/master/Multiset/src/ch/claude_martin/Multiset.java

Update 2024/04/26:
I gave this a bit of a rework. It's mostly the same, but I did remove some outdated parts of the code.
You can still just copy `Multiset.java` and the test if you want to use it. I won't bother creating a module.
